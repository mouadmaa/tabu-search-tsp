# Morocco Cities Visualization for TSP

A Python project for visualizing Moroccan cities as part of a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution.

## Overview

This project provides a modular implementation for visualizing major cities in Morocco. This is the first step toward solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, showing the geographic distribution of cities before calculating optimal routes between them.
