# Traveling Salesman Problem - Morocco

A Python implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Tabu Search algorithm, with an application to finding optimal routes between Moroccan cities.

## Overview

This project provides a modular implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem. The application specifically focuses on finding an optimal route to visit all major cities in Morocco, visualizing both the cities and the resulting route on a map-like display.
